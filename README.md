# cpphw
CPP Home work for school

##What is this

Well this is a collection of c++ files written to be compiled on g++ or mingw compiler.

This is not a complete software it is just bits of code.
And yes you can use it If you want.

## Why

This is my unfortunate HHW for summer vacations

## Dev environment

I used [Atom](https://atom.io) editor to code the files and [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) compiler to compile the code (compiled code is not included since it might not run on other environments as I use Linux :-) .
